- I'm Emi, better known as SmgMakotoLife ‚ù§Ô∏è
- I'm a trans MtF Woman, fresh out of being a minor (Almost 19 I'm so damn old)  üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚öß üëµ
- I like a lot of video games, mainly Persona (I know I know), Danganronpa (A body has been discovered!), and Ace Attorney (OBJECTION!)
- I mostly just throw together a bunch of code/projects for random ideas I have in my head, that's mostly why I'm here lmao.
- I run a discord server! It contains a bot that I've taken from a few sources and put together that lets us play LibRetro (classic games) through a specialized discord channel!!
- "I am myself! I'll never forget that again!" - Sumire Yoshizawa
- "Enough of this high and mighty BULLSHIT! You're PISSING ME OFF!" - Goro Akechi
- I'm literally the wholesomeness of Sumire combined with the edge and attractiveness of Akechi and I have witnesses!!
- anyway, link to my server, boom!: https://discord.gg/3eRhsFH5y
